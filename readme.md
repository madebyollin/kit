# 🐱 kit

Adds shortcuts for common `git` operations. Any `git` command can be run with `kit`. Many of the command aliases are pulled from [this post](http://www.saintsjd.com/2012/01/a-better-ui-for-git/).

**This project is not intended for public use. There are other git wrappers you should use, e.g. [legit](http://www.git-legit.org/).**

Features are added when I find myself running the same `git` commands frequently.
